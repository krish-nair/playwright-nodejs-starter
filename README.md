## Demo code for my Pluralsight course: Playwright in Node.js Fundamentals

Starting a new end-to-end test automation project? My course will teach you how to test web applications using the open-source tool Playwright with Node.js. Try it and never look back!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a "starter" repo, meaning it contains only the minimal setup to enable learners to code along with the video course.
